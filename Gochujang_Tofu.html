            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
				<li>Drain your tofu and either A) cut into approximately 1" cubes or B) tear into irregular pieces for crispy tofu nuggets. Lay tofu pieces on one half of a clean, lint-free kitchen towel. Fold over the other half of the towel and gently press to remove excess liquid. Leave the tofu to drain for at least 15 minutes.</li>
				<li>In the meantime, preheat your oven to 425Â°F and line a baking tray with parchment or a silicone baking mat.</li>
				<li>Transfer the pressed tofu to a mixing bowl. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle in salt and pepper. Toss until evenly coated. Try to be gentle so that the tofu cubes or nuggets stay intact. I find using a big flexible rubber spatula helps.</li>
				<li>Sprinkle the cornstarch over the seasoned tofu and once again toss until tofu is evenly coated and there's no dry cornstarch left at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
				<li>Arrange the tofu on your prepared baking sheet so that the pieces aren't touching. Bake for 15 minutes and give the pieces a flip. Bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the tofu is as crispy as you like it! The time will vary a little depending on how thoroughly you pressed your tofu.</li>
				<li>While your tofu bakes, measure ingredients for the gochujang sauce.</li>
				<li>You can measure all the ingredients for your sauce directly into a nonstick skillet. Whisk together.</li>
				<li>Heat the sauce over medium-high until it begins to bubble. Then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, for about 3-5 minutes, until sugar has dissolved fully and sauce has thickened slightly. Add an extra tablespoon or so of water as needed to thin out the sauce to your preferred consistency. </li>
				<li>When your tofu is done baking, transfer it to your saucepan and stir to coat. Alternatively, you can serve the crispy tofu with the gochujang sauce on the side.</li>
				<li>Serve with steamed white rice, garnish with fresh scallions and toasted sesame seeds. </li>
