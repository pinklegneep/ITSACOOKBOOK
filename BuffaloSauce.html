            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
				<li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Continue cooking, gently simmering the butter and stirring the pan occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the milk solids at the bottom of the pan start to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. It should smell nutty and almost like caramel or butterscotch.</li>
				<li>Remove from the heat and carefully transfer the very hot browned butter to a large, heatproof mixing bowl. Add the garlic, stirring until the garlic is fragrant, a few seconds. Add the hot sauce, brown sugar and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk vigorously until emulsified. Taste and add more salt, pepper and brown sugar as desired.</li>
				<li>Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week. This is an excellent dipping sauce for French fries, roasted cauliflower and any kind of chicken (grilled, roasted or fried), or slathered between two slices of toasted bread in a deli sandwich.</li>
