            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
				<li>In a large bowl, add the powdered sugar, softened vegan butter, peppermint extract and coconut milk. Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, mix, starting on low and increasing to medium speed. At first it will look very dry and crumbly, but after a few minutes it well soften and be more of a dough. If it's too wet and sticky, add a little more powdered sugar. It should feel like play dough. Set aside.</li>
				<li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop about a tablespoon at a time of the peppermint mixture and shape into a disc. Place the patties in a single layer on the prepared pan, and repeat until you have used all of the mixture.</li>
				<li>Place the patties in the refrigerator for 45 minutes, or freeze for 15 minutes. This will help them harden a bit and set.</li>
				<li>Melt the chocolate and coconut oil over a double boiler, preferably, or in the microwave. Stir well so it's smooth. Let it cool for just a few minutes.</li>
				<li>Remove the patties from the refrigerator or freezer and dip one patty at a time into the chocolate mixture, using a fork to help you coat it on all sides. Return back to the parchment lined pan.</li>
				<li>Place the pan back in the freezer for 5 minutes to harden, or the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Once set, place in a container with a lid and store in the refrigerator. At room temperature, the chocolate will start to melt. They will keep for about 2 weeks or longer in the freezer. Enjoy!</li>
