            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
				<li>420 g powdered sugar</li>
				<li>▢ 2 tablespoons vegan butter, softened</li>
				<li>▢ 2 teaspoons peppermint extract</li>
				<li>▢ 4 tablespoons full fat coconut milk the creamy white part only</li>
				<li>    ▢ 360 g vegan chocolate chips</li>
				<li>▢ 2 tablespoons refined coconut oil</li>
				<li>    In a large bowl, add the powdered sugar, softened vegan butter, peppermint extract and coconut milk. Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, mix, starting on low and increasing to medium speed. At first it will look very dry and crumbly, but after a few minutes it well soften and be more of a dough. If it's too wet and sticky, add a little more powdered sugar. It should feel like play dough. Set aside.</li>
				<li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop about a tablespoon at a time of the peppermint mixture and shape into a disc. Place the patties in a single layer on the prepared pan, and repeat until you have used all of the mixture.</li>
